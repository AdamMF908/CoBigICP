* Reconstruction results of ETH Hauptgebaude generated by CoBigICP and GICP. Both estimated aligned point clouds are colored, 
with the ground truth being white. *

For more information, please refer to our paper:
- [ ] An uncompleted task

Two consecutive point cloud frames from ETH Hauptgebaude are already loaded so if you wanna have a brief look at the algorithm, simply run CoBigICP_fun.m.
